    <h2>3. Repayment</h2>
    <p>
        Accepted MCAs are repaid via automated ACH debits or credit card remittances. 
        Repayment is based on a percentage of your business revenue until the agreed total (advance × factor rate) is satisfied. 
        There is no fixed maturity date. Repayment may fluctuate based on revenue performance.
